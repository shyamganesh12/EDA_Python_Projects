# EDA_Python_Projects
Exploratory data analysis is a critical process in the Data science field. We use this process to perform initial investigations on data and find patterns, anomalies, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

# Objectives
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Evaluate data quality
Perform data cleaning and transformation
Answer questions about the data
Create data visualizations
Use the data for further analysis and projects
